## NullReferenceException: Stack trace
Stack traces are reports of the path code took to get to an execution point.
You must understand stack traces before solving runtime exceptions.  

Click on an error in the [Console window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html) to see the full stack trace.

<<Programming/Common Errors/Stack Trace Breakdown.md>>

If the stack trace isn't leading you to a valid line of code: **save**, make sure your code has recompiled (there are no [compiler errors](../../Editor/Compiler%20Errors.md)), and cause the exception again.
Double-click on an error that contains a stack trace involving user code to be taken to that line.

You can find a more detailed breakdown of stack traces [here](../../Stack%20Traces.md).
