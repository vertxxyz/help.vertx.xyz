```
The field 'foo' is assigned to but its value is never used
```

You have written to to a field, but the field was never accessed.

### Resolution
**Either:**
:::note  
Finish writing your code, and read from the field.  
```csharp
_example.Method(); // Accessing the field by calling a method.
var value = _example.Value; // Accessing a member from the field.
var value = _example[0]; // Accessing an index from the field (if it was a collection).
```  
:::  
**Or**  
:::note  
Remove the field if you are not planning to use it.
```diff
-private Example _example = new Example();
```  
:::  
**Or**  
:::note  
If you are accessing the field via some other means—like reflection—you can mark it with the [`[UsedImplicitly]`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Reference__Code_Annotation_Attributes.html#UsedImplicitlyAttribute) attribute.
```csharp
[UsedImplicitly]
private Example _example = new Example();
```  
Also note that you may also need to use the [`[Preserve]`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Scripting.PreserveAttribute.html) attribute if you are building using AOT (IL2CPP for example).
