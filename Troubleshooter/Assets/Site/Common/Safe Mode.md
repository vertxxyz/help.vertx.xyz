### Safe Mode
#### Description
Safe Mode is a new Unity feature that allows you to open a project *without* importing all the assets.  
In Safe Mode you have access to compilation errors through the Unity Console, and access to the Package Manager to resolve any issues with package configuration.  

Entering Safe Mode is optional, though entirely harmless. In projects with already imported assets entering safe mode may be wholly unnecessary, but it is a useful feature otherwise.  

If you are presented with this option, it is likely best to enter Safe Mode to resolve your errors. It will automatically exit to normal operation once those errors have been resolved.
