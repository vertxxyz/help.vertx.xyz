## Incorrect scenes in build
Unity only builds the scenes listed in the build settings. The scene at index 0 is the only scene loaded by default.

### Resolution
Edit the build settings (**File | Build Settings...**) and add your scenes to the build. You can click the **add open scenes** button, or drag the scene assets into the Scenes in build area.  
You can reorder scenes by dragging. The scene at index 0 is the scene that will be loaded when the game launches.

If you still have issues with your scenes once you rebuild, check the [player logs](../Logs.md).
