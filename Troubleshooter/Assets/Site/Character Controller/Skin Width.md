# Character Controller: Skin width

Skin width defines a shell around the controller allowing for slight object penetration, while acting like a buffer zone to smooth out collisions.  
Skin width is a critical setting that reduces the chances of getting stuck on surfaces.  

## Resolution
Reduce the radius of the character controller, or the skin width property.

Selecting the character controller and looking in the scene view should show how large it is in comparison to your visuals.
