## Stuck tools
### My tool works, it just doesn't move
If a tool is stuck you can often fix it by switching tools and using another one momentarily.  

If the move tool is stuck for example:
1. Switch to the rotate tool.
1. Rotate your object ever so slightly.
1. Switch back to the move tool.

### My tool is greyed-out
GameObjects marked as [static](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StaticObjects.html) cannot be moved **at runtime**. If you want to move it, it should not be marked as static.
