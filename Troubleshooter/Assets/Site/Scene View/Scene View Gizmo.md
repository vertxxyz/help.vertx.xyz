# Scene gizmo

The [Scene gizmo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html) is an axis navigation tool, generally docked to the top right of the Scene view window.  
- Click the center—or the label below the gizmo—to toggle between **Perspective** and **Orthographic** views.
  - Orthographic perspectives flatten object distance, switch to perspective if unintentional.
- Each axis arm can be clicked on to realign the view to that axis.  
- Rotation lock can be toggled via the lock icon to the top right.

Using the tools mentioned above you can fix most rotation issues with the Scene view.
