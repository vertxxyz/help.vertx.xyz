## Scene view overlays
### Global overlays
Right-click on the Scene tab and select **Overlay Menu**, then disable the tool you would like to display.  
You can also press the tilda key <kbd>`</kbd>, which is the default shortcut to bring up the menu.

### Tool overlays
Certain overlays appear when certain objects are selected. The particle system overlay only appears when an object with a Particle System is selected. If your overlay is designed with specific types of objects in mind, try deselecting the current object.  
If the Inspector has been [locked](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InspectorOptions.html) it may prevent new objects being inspected for the overlay.

In rare cases you may need to [reset the window](../Windows/Resetting%20Windows.md) or [layout](../Windows/Resetting%20Layout.md) to reset the overlay state.
