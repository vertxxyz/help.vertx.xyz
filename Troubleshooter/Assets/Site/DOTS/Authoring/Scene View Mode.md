## Entities authoring: Scene view mode
The Scene view doesn't come with an authoring mode dropdown, unlike the Entities Hierarchy or Inspector.  

To switch the Scene view between modes you must navigate to **Preferences | Entities | Baking | Scene view mode** to change between **authoring data** and **runtime data**.
