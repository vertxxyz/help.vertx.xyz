## Unity Hub: Editor installation
You must download and install the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) to install the editor.

### Which version to install
It's generally recommended you install the latest LTS (long term support) version of Unity.  
When choosing a version from the Hub, there will be an `LTS` tag, and it should be marked _recommended version_.  

Alternatively, when starting a project it can be helpful to have up-to-date features, with the aim to be on an LTS when your game is released. In this case you can choose a non-LTS version, the "Tech stream", or a Beta or Alpha version, at increasing levels of risk of unexpected or unfixed editor issues.

### Versions listed in the Hub
