## Unity Hub: Editor installation issues
### Make space on your primary drive
You need space on your primary (C:) drive as the Unity Hub will cache downloads there during installations.

Modern versions of the Hub allow you to change these locations (**Preferences ‚öôÔ∏è | Installs**), but space on the primary drive is still necessary for certain components.

### Antivirus
Check that the Hub is not being blocked by antivirus/security programs, and attempt to whitelist the Hub.

### Logging locations
Check the logs ([documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html)), looking for setup issues close to the bottom of the log:
- Windows: `%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\UnityHub\logs`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application support/UnityHub/logs`
- Linux: `~/.config/UnityHub/logs`  

### Different installation locations
Try installing into a different location using the settings (**Preferences ‚öôÔ∏è | Installs | Installs Location**).

If you are on Mac, you should check that the Unity Hub has write permissions in the **Privacy and Security | Files and Folders** preferences for the folder you are using (if present).

### Permissions
Don't launch the Hub with Administrator privileges as it may prompt you to avoid doing so. Proper configuration and application permissions should be applied normally.

### Restart
1. Restart your computer.
1. When the Hub next opens, install any updates it may have.


### Ask about it on the forums
**Check the pinned messages** üìå, and search the [Unity Hub forums](https://forum.unity.com/forums/unity-hub.142/) for your issue, and then make a post there if you cannot find a resolution.
