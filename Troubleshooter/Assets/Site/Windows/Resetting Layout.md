# Resetting layout
Selecting a layout resets the editor windows to match.  
There are two methods to do this.  

The layout dropdown in the top right of the interface **Layout | Default**:    
![Layouts dropdown](reset-layout-0.png)  

The menu bar via **Window | Layouts | Default**:
![Window layouts menu](reset-layout.png)

If your problem persists, try restarting Unity.
