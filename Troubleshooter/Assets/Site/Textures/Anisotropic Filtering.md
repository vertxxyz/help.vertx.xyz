# Anisotropic Filtering

Anisotropic filtering increases Texture quality when viewed from a grazing angle.  This rendering is resource-intensive on the graphics card. Increasing the level of anisotropy is usually a good idea for ground and floor Textures.
## Resolution
Increase the **aniso level** on the Texture asset.  

If this does not affect the texture make sure that **Edit | Project Settings | Quality | Anisotropic Textures** isn't set to **disabled**.
