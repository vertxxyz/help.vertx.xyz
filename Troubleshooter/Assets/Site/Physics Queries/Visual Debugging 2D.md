# Physics queries: Visual debugging
## Debugging functions
Use a form of [visual debugging](../Debugging/Visual%20Debugging.md) to visualise your queries in the space of the scene.  
Be particularly cautious to provide the exact same values you use in your query.

## Common mistakes resolved by visual debugging
Watch out for these common mistakes:

- Using a **position** in place of an input requiring a **direction**.
- Using a position or direction from a different object than expected.
- Using a position or direction in the wrong space. Queries usually made in world space.
