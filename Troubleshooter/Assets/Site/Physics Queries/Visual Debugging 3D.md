You can utilise the [Physics Debugger](../Debugging/Physics%20Debugger.md) to visualise your queries in the Scene view.

Otherwise, you can use a [visual debugging](../Debugging/Visual%20Debugging.md) API to draw these queries, which can be preferable to have a more persistent or elaborate visualisation setup.  
Be particularly cautious to provide the exact same values you use in your query.
