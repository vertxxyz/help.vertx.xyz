## Log not appearing

<<General/Console Window.md>>  

If your logs don't clear, you have compilation errors to resolve. If they are not resolved, changes to your scripts will not be compiled.

Keep in mind that the **Collapse** toggle can also hide new messages.  

#### Exceptions
When logging it is important to place your log **behind** any error that can occur, as exceptions will halt execution.
<<Code/Logging/Logging 1.rtf>>  

See the [Logging how-to](Logging%20How-to.md) for more information.  

#### Debugger
If logs are not being printed, the code may not be executing. To debug this properly you can learn to use the debugger, breakpoints, and step over code line by line [here](../Debugger.md).
