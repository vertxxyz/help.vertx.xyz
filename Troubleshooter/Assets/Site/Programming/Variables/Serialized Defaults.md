## Serialized defaults
### Description
The value a serialized variable is set to in code is only the default when a new instance is created from scratch.  
After the value has been serialized, that value will override anything that is initialised to code.

### Resolution
Set the value to the variable via the [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html).  
The value in code is only a default for new instances.
