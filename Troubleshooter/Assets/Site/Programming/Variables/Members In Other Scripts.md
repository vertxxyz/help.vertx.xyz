### Referring to Members in Other Scripts

#### [Serialized References](Other%20Members/Serialized%20References.md)
Serialized references are exposed via the inspector and are defined per-instance.

#### [Singletons](Other%20Members/Singletons.md)
Singletons are referenced in code and require there only **one** of the target type.

#### Alternate Methods
There are other methods to refer to members in other scripts. There are dependency injection frameworks, different ways to utilise the `static` keyword, etc. Generally these can be avoided until users are familiar with more basic and common concepts.
