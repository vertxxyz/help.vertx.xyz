## Referring to members in other scripts

### [Serialized references](Other%20Members/Serialized%20References.md)
Serialized references are exposed via the inspector and are defined per-instance.

### [Singletons](Other%20Members/Singletons.md)
Singletons are referenced in code and require **only one instance** of the target type.

### Alternate methods
Other ways to refer to external members include dependency injection frameworks and varied use of the `static` keyword. Generally these can be avoided until users are familiar with more basic and common concepts.
