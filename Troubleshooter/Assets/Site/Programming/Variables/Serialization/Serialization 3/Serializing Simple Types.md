## Serializing simple types
### Check the type is correct.
Hover over the type in your IDE to find the namespace[^1], then check the documentation to make sure the type you want to reference actually uses that namespace.  
Common improperly referenced namespaces include: `System`, `System.Numerics`, and `UnityEngine.UIElements`. If you referenced one of these namespaces and do not understand why, it's likely the first place to look!

### Check you are editing the inspected object.
Are you *sure* the inspected object is the type that contains the variable you are declaring? ðŸ‘€  
Check that your Component or Scriptable Object is the same.  

Using your IDE's Go To Definition[^2] feature should make it clear what type is actually being exposed.
