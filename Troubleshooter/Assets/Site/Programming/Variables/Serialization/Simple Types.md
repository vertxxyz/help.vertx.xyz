## Serializing simple types
### Check the type is correct.
Hover over the type in your IDE to find the namespace[^1], then check the documentation to make sure its namespace is identical.  
Common improperly referenced namespaces include: `System`, `System.Numerics`, and `UnityEngine.UIElements`. If you referenced one of these namespaces and do not understand why, it's likely the first place to look!  

You can always resolve namespaces by manually specifying them when you use a type, or by specifying names in the using block. For example:
```csharp
using Object = UnityEngine.Object;
```

### Check you are editing the inspected object.
Are you *sure* the inspected object is the type that contains the variable you are declaring? ðŸ‘€  
Check that your Component or Scriptable Object is the same.  

Using your IDE's **go to definition**[^2] feature should make it clear what type is actually being exposed.
