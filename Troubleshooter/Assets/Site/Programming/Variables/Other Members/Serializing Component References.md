### Serializing Component References
<<Variables/Serialized References.md>>
Ensure you have dragged a **Component** into the slot or you will get a [Null Reference Exception](../../Common%20Errors/Runtime%20Exceptions/Null%20Reference%20Exception.md) (Unassigned Reference Exception).  
You can also drag the entire GameObject from the hierarchy into the slot and the relevant Component will be referenced.
