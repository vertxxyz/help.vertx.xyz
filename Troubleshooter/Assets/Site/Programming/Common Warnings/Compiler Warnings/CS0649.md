## [CS0649](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0649)
### Description
It is extremely common to see this warning in Unity because of an unassigned serialized variable.  
Unity's serializer populates serialized values completely unseen by the compiler, so it does not understand that the value is assigned at runtime.

### Resolution
**Either:**  
:::note 
Assign a default value to serialized fields.  
```csharp
[SerializeField]
private Example example = default;
```  
:::  

**Or**  
:::note
Create a file named `csc.rsp` in Assets that contains only:  
```
/nowarn:0649
```  
This will silence the warning across the project, even when valid, but a functioning IDE should still indicate when a variable is unused.  
:::  

**Or**  
:::note
Selectively wrap serialized fields in:
```csharp
#pragma warning disable CS0168
// Serialized fields
#pragma warning restore CS0168
```
