## Coroutines: Halting
### Description
Coroutines do not work in Edit Mode.

### Resolution
If you are running a coroutine in Edit Mode it will not function by default.  
You can add the [Editor Coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.editorcoroutines@latest) package to run coroutines in Edit Mode. There are some restrictions listed in the documentation.
