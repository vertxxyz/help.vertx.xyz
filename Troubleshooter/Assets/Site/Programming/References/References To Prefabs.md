## Referencing Prefabs from Scenes
::::note  
#### 1. Expose a serialized reference to the target component
The target component is a **component** on the **root** of the prefab asset.  
The field must be marked with [`SerializeField`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html):  
<<Code/Variables/Prefab Reference.rtf>>

**or** can be `public`:  
<<Code/Variables/Public Prefab Reference.rtf>>  

:::info{.inline}
This example uses `PrefabComponentType`, it will need to be replaced with the target type.

#### 2. Reference the instance in the Inspector

:::error{.small .img-note-wide}
Drag the prefab asset into the slot or you will get an [`UnassignedReferenceException`](../Common%20Errors/Runtime%20Exceptions/UnassignedReferenceException.md).

::::note  
#### 3. Access the member you care about
`public` members on the target component can be accessed via the instance.
```csharp
// Variables and properties
var variable = _instance.Variable;
_instance.Variable = variable;

// Methods
_instance.Method();
```
If you don't have autocomplete, [configure your IDE](../IDE%20Configuration.md) to easily find member names and get error highlighting.

### Notes
#### Serialization and instancing
When cloning a component using [`Instantiate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html), all attached objects and components are cloned with their properties set like those of the original object.  
Serialized references are locally maintained when Objects are instanced; references in prefab instances will be local, not referring to the original. Without indirection it's not possible for a prefab instance to maintain a reference to the prefab it was spawned from.

#### Prefabs and runtime
Prefabs are an editor-only concept. At runtime prefab instances are not logically connected to what spawned them, and nor is any information about prefab hierarchies or overrides maintained.

#### Prefab roots
The prefab root is the top-level GameObject of a prefab. You cannot directly reference the children of a prefab from the scene, so prefab children should generally reference a component on the root if they want data you've configured from the scene.

#### Referencing Components, not GameObjects
Don't reference a `GameObject` unless you only use its methods. Referencing a component directly avoids using `GetComponent`.

```csharp
/* --- ðŸŸ  Wasteful and error-prone --- */
[SerializeField] private GameObject _prefab;

void Spawn()
{
    GameObject instance = Instantiate(_prefab);
    // GetComponent is required to do anything beyond calling SetActive.
    instance.GetComponent<Example>().Foo();
}

/* --- ðŸŸ¢ Simple and communicates usage --- */
[SerializeField] private Example _prefab;

void Spawn()
{
    Example instance = Instantiate(_prefab);
    // Has direct access to useful methods.
    instance.Foo();
}
```
