## Input Manager

`ArgumentException: Input Button x is not setup`


Generic controls for the built-in input system are configurable in the [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html) (**Edit | Project Settings | Input Manager**).  
The axes defined here can be used in the [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) class' Button and Axis functions.  

### Resolution
Ensure that the key used in the function is identical to an axis declared in the Input Manager.  

:::warning
**Identical** includes capitalisation and spaces
