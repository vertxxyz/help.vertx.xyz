## Key conventions
### Description
It is much easier to use the input function overloads that take a [KeyCode](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html).  
Keycodes are autocompleted by your IDE[^1], so they don't require documentation to use.

### Resolution
If you're not okay with switching to Keycode, see the [mapping virtual axes to controls](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html) section for the correct naming conventions of keys.  

:::warning
Capitalisation is important. Uppercase keys will appear unknown.
:::  

[^1]: Check [IDE configuration](../../IDE%20Configuration.md) if you do not have autocomplete.
