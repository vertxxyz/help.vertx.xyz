## Physics queries: Errors

Ensure that your code has actually compiled.

<<General/Console Window.md>>
<<General/Errors.md>>

### Runtime exceptions
Read all errors and warnings present in the console at runtime.  
[Exceptions](../Common%20Errors/Runtime%20Exceptions.md) will halt execution, causing code execution to move to the first place they can be caught. This may cause your query's code to exit prematurely.
