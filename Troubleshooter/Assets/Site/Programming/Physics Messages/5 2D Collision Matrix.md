### Layer Collision Matrix

Unity's layer-based collision can exclude colliders and triggers from interacting with each other at all.  
Check that the toggles in the project settings match with the two colliders in question.  

The Physics 2D settings are separate from the 3D ones.  
See **Edit/Project Settings/Physics 2D**, and the **Layer Collision Matrix** at the bottom.
