## Physics messages (2D)
There are two types of physics messages, collisions and triggers.  
Decide which type of interaction you want before implementing a message.  
Physics messages are sent to scripts attached to both bodies.

### Collisions
Collisions are physical interactions between two solid bodies.  
### Triggers
Triggers can be passed through. Trigger messages are sent when two bodies touch where at least one is non-solid.
