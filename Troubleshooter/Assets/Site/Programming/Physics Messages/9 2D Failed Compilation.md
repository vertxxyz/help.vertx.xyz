## Failed compilation
Ensure that your code has actually compiled.

<<General/Console Window.md>>
<<General/Errors.md>>

### Runtime exceptions
Read all errors and warnings present in the console at runtime.
[Exceptions](../../Runtime%20Exceptions.md) will halt execution, causing code execution to move to the first place they can be caught. This may cause your message to exit prematurely.
