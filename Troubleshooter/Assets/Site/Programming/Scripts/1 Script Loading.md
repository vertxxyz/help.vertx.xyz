## Class and script names

**Save your Script**  
First, ensure you have saved.  

Next, ensure that the name of your class is **identical** to the file name of your script.  
You can find the name of your class where your code looks like:  
<<Code/Scripts/Script Loading 1.rtf>>  

In this example if your script's file name is not also named `ClassName`, you must change them to be identical.  

:::warning
**Identical** includes capitalisation and spaces
