## Class and script names

1. Save your script.
2. The name of your class must be **identical** to its file name.  
   You can find the name of your class where your code looks like:  
   <<Code/Scripts/Script Loading 1.html>>

    In this example if your script is not named ::![Script Icon](script-icon.svg){.inline} `ClassName`::{.note}, you must rename it to be identical.  
   :::warning
   Identical includes capitalisation and spaces
   :::  
   Note that there should only be one component or scriptable object per file due to this restriction.
