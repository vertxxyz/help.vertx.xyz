## Editor contexts
### Description
Scripts in Editor contexts (Editor folders, Editor-only assembly definitions) will only function in the Editor.  
This means that attaching them to runtime objects is invalid.

### Resolution
- [I am **not** using assembly definitions](Editor%20Folders.md) (Default).
- [I am using assembly definitions.](Assembly%20Definitions.md)
