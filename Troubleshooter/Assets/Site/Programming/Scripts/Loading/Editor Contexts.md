## Editor contexts
### Description
Scripts in Editor contexts (Editor folders, Editor-only Assembly Definitions) will only function in the Editor.  
This means that attaching them to runtime objects is invalid.

### Resolution
- [I am **not** using Assembly Definitions](Editor%20Folders.md) (Default).
- [I am using Assembly Definitions.](Assembly%20Definitions.md)
