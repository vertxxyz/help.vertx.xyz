## Diagonal movement and normalization
If digital input is not [normalized](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3-normalized.html) before it's used, it will be a different magnitude (length) when applied at a diagonal.

Picture the vector that makes up movement as a square, the magnitude of a vector at one of the corners of the square is $\sqrt{2}$ (`1.4142...`), it should be `1` instead, which is achieved by normalization.

### Resolution

[Normalize](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3-normalized.html) your input vector before using it.

```csharp
Vector3 input = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));

// ðŸ”´ Incorrect.
Vector3 movement = input * speed;

// ðŸŸ¢ Correct, input is normalized before being scaled.
Vector2 movement = input.normalized * speed;
```

:::info
If you scale multiple `float` arguments with a vector you should multiply them together first with brackets: `vector * (scalarA * scalarB)`.  
This avoids extra multiplications.
