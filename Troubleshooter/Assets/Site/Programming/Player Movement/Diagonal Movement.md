## Diagonal movement and normalization
If digital input is not [normalized](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3-normalized.html) before it's used, it will be a different magnitude (length) when applied at a diagonal.

Picture the vector that makes up movement as a square, the magnitude of a vector at one of the corners of the square is $\sqrt{2}$ (`1.4142...`)[^1], it should be `1` instead, which is achieved by normalization.

### Resolution

::::note
#### I want continuous `0->1` movement maintained from analog controls like joysticks
Normalisation is not always desirable. If your input is analogâ€”meaning it has continuous input values, not just `0` and `1`â€”then you may just want to ensure it's within a `0->1` range by using [`ClampMagnitude`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.ClampMagnitude.html).

```csharp
Vector3 input = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));

// ðŸ”´ Incorrect.
Vector3 movement = input * speed;

// ðŸŸ¢ Correct, input is clamped to a max length of 1 before being scaled.
Vector3 movement = Vector3.ClampMagnitude(input, 1) * speed;
```

::::note
#### I want normalized movement (`0` or `1`) regardless of the controls
For some games with strict controls it can be desirable to have digital movement. In this case you should [normalize](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3-normalized.html) your input vector before using it.

```csharp
Vector3 input = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));

// ðŸ”´ Incorrect.
Vector3 movement = input * speed;

// ðŸŸ¢ Correct, input is normalized before being scaled.
Vector3 movement = input.normalized * speed;
```

:::info
If you scale multiple `float` arguments with a vector you should multiply them together first with brackets: `vector * (scalarA * scalarB)`.  
This avoids extra multiplications.

[^1]: The magnitude of a 2D vector is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. This is just the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) applied to the triangle constructed by the two axes that are at a right angle to each other.
