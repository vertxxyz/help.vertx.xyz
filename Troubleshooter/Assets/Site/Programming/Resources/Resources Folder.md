## Resources folders

The Resources API requires that assets are loaded within the Resources folder.  
This is any folder in the project with the name `Resources`.  
If an asset isn't nested under a Resources folder it cannot be loaded via the API.  
See [Resources](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.html).

### Resolution
Move the asset under a folder named `Resources`.

Do not disregard capitalisation.
