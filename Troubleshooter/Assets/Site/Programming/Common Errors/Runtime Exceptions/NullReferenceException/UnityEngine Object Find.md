1. Only active gameobjects can be found.
1. Names are case-sensitive.
1. If your path starts with a `/` then the path must begin at the root of the scene.
1. Assignment must occur before access. Often you would use [`Awake`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) to get, and [`Start`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start.html) to use.

### [`Transform.Find`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Find.html)

### [`GameObject.FindWithTag`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.FindWithTag.html)
