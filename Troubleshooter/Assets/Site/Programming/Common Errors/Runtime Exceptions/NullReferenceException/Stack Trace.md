## NullReferenceException: Stack trace
Stack traces are reports of the path code took to get to an execution point.  
You must understand stack traces before solving runtime exceptions.  

<<Programming/Common Errors/Stack Trace Breakdown.md>>

You can find a more detailed breakdown of stack traces [here](../../Stack%20Traces.md).  
If the stack trace isn't leading you to a valid line of code: **save**, and cause the exception again.
