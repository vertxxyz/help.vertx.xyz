## NullReferenceException: UnityEngine.Object â€” Serialized

1. Check that all references have been assigned in the inspector[^1].
1. Search the Scene (`t:ExampleComponent` for example) when the error occurs, ensuring there aren't duplicate components causing the issue.
1. Remove any `GetComponent` calls that could be overriding your reference[^2].
1. Check that you are not using modern null checking operators[^3] (`?.`, `??`, `??=`).
1. Ensure nothing is destroying the Object, or setting it to `null` before you attempt to use it.

Logs can also be made to ping objects they reference using the [context parameter](../../../Debugging/Logging/How-to.md).

[^2]: A common mistake is missing `GetComponent` setting a serialized value to `null` in `Awake` or `Start`.
