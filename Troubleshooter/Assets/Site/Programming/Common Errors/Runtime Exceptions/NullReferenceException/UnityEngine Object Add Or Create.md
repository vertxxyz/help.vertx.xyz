#### Find the cause of `null` values

**Or:**  
:::note
#### Check the reference isn't null before trying to access it
- Exit early if `null`.
    ```csharp
    if (example == null)
    {
        // Exit early.
        return;
    }
    // Code that uses example.
    ```
- Nest your code in a `null` check.
    ```csharp
    if (example != null)
    {
        // Code that uses example.
    }
    ```  
Do not use modern null checking operators[^1] (`?.`, `??`, `??=`) to check for null.
