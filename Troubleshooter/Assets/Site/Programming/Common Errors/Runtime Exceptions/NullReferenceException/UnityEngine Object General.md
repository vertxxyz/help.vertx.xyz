## NullReferenceException: UnityEngine.Object â€” General

To resolve a `NullReferenceException` caused by a `null` `UnityEngine.Object` you can choose one of the following options:

**First:**  
:::note
#### Assign a reference to the variable (choose one)
- Drag and drop the reference in the component's inspector[^1] (if your field is serialized by Unity).
- Manually assign the reference in a method like `Awake` or `Start` using [`GetComponent`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html) or similar.
- Initialise the variable with [`AddComponent`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.AddComponent.html) or [`CreateInstance`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.CreateInstance.html).
:::  
**Then:**  
:::note
- Ensure that nothing is destroying the Object, or setting it to `null` before you attempt to use it.
- Check assignments use correct assumptions. Some examples:
  - `GetComponent<Example>()` will return `null` if an `Example` component isn't attached to the same GameObject[^2].
  - `Camera.main` will return null if there isn't a camera tagged as `MainCamera`.
- Check that you are not using modern null checking operators[^3] (`?.`, `??`, `??=`).
- Assignment must occur before access. Often you would use [`Awake`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) to get, and [`Start`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start.html) to use.
- If the object is assigned in the Inspector, search the Scene (`t:ExampleComponent` for example), ensuring there aren't duplicate components causing the issue.
