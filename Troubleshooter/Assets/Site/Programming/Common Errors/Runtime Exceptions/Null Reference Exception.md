### Null Reference Exception
A `NullReferenceException` happens when your script code tries to use a variable which isnâ€™t set, or found. It's probably just unassigned in the inspector.  
The error tells you this, and also gives you the line where the error is occurring, so you can go to that line and narrow down what is missing.  

See [General Debugging](../../Debugging.md) for troubleshooting techniques.  
See [Serializing Component References](../../Variables/Other%20Members/Serializing%20Component%20References.md) to learn how to assign variables in the Inspector.
