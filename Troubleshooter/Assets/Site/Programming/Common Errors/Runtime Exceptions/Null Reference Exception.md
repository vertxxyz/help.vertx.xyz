### Null Reference Exception
#### Description
A `NullReferenceException` happens when your script code tries to use a variable which isnâ€™t set, or found. It's probably just unassigned in the inspector.  
The error gives you the line and column where it is occurring, so you can go there to narrow down what is missing.  
*Declaring* a reference variable does not automatically assign it an appropriate value.  

#### Resolution

- Assign a reference to the variable
    - Drag and drop the reference **in the inspector** (if it is a serialized)
    - Manually assign the reference in a method like Awake or Start
- Check whether the reference is not null before trying to access it  
    `if(example != null)`  

Additionally ensure that nothing is destroying the Object, or setting it to `null` before you attempt to use it.  
Method usage that follows incorrect assumptions can also return null values. For example, `GetComponent<Example>` will return `null` if `Example` is not present on the same GameObject the current Component is attached to.  
When troubleshooting which variable is null, be aware that only reference types can be null. Ie. `class`, `interface`, or `delegate` variables.
