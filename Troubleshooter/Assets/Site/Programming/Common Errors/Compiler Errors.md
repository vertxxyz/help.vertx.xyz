## Common compiler errors

- [CS0104](Compiler%20Errors/CS0104.md): 'reference' is an ambiguous reference between 'X identifier' and 'Y identifier'
- [CS0106](Compiler%20Errors/CS0106.md): The modifier 'modifier' is not valid for this item
- [CS0120](Compiler%20Errors/CS0120.md): An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'Foo'
- [CS0119](Compiler%20Errors/CS0119.md): 'Foo' is a 'Bar', which is not valid in the given context
- [CS0266](Compiler%20Errors/CS0266.md): Cannot implicitly convert type 'Foo' to 'Bar'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)
- [CS0236](Compiler%20Errors/CS0236.md): A field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property 'Foo'
- [CS0246](Compiler%20Errors/CS0246.md): The type or namespace name 'Foo' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  
- [CS0619](Compiler%20Errors/CS0619.md): 'Foo' is obsolete: 'Foo has been removed. Use Bar instead.'
- [CS1022](Compiler%20Errors/CS1022.md): Type or namespace definition, or end-of-file expected
- [CS1061](Compiler%20Errors/CS1061.md): Type 'Foo' does not contain a definition for 'Bar' and no extension method 'Bar' of type 'Foo' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  
- [CS1503](Compiler%20Errors/CS1503.md): Argument 'x' cannot convert from Foo to Bar
- [CS1513](Compiler%20Errors/CS1513.md): } expected
- [CS1612](Compiler%20Errors/CS1612.md): Cannot modify the return value of 'Foo' because it is not a variable  
- [CS1624](Compiler%20Errors/CS1624.md): The body of 'Foo.Bar()' cannot be an iterator block because 'type' is not an iterator interface type
- [CS1644](Compiler%20Errors/CS1644.md): Feature 'feature' is not part of the C# 4.0 language specification
