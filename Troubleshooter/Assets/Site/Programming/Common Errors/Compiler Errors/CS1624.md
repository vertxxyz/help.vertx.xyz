## [CS1624](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs1624)
### Description

The `yield` keyword can only be used in an iterator context. This requires it to be returning specific interface types.  
Typically with Unity this keyword is used in the context of a [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html).  

### Resolution

Convert your method to a coroutine if waiting is required, and start it appropriately.  

#### Example
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1624 1.html>>  

**becomes:**

<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1624 2.html>>  

:::info
Coroutines must also be started correctly, and not started continuously as they are automatically continued until they finish or are cancelled.  
See [StartCoroutine](../../Coroutines/StartCoroutine.md) and [StopCoroutine](../../Coroutines/StopCoroutine.md) for more information.
