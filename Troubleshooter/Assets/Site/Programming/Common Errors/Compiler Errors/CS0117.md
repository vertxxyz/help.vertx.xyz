```
'type' does not contain a definition for 'identifier'
```

### Description
This error is given when a type does not contain a member that is attempting to be referenced.

### Resolution
#### Search in code and documentation
1. [Make sure you have autocomplete and errors underlined in red.](../../IDE%20Configuration.md) A configured IDE is a requirement.
2. Check with autocomplete for versions of the member you wanted to access.
3. If the member cannot be found, make sure it is present in the [Script Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) relevant to your version of Unity, or the relevant [Package Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html) associated with the package the code should be in.

#### I am sure the member should be present
:::warning
Make sure you do not have a type with the same name as the target type!
:::

You can figure out whether this is the case by using your IDE's **Go To Declaration** feature.

:::note
#### I have a type with the same name
Your options for fixing this error are:  
1. Rename your type to avoid the conflict.
2. Access the correct type via its namespace. Eg. `UnityEngine.Cursor`.
3. Specify the correct type as a using statement. Eg. `using Cursor = UnityEngine.Cursor;`

#### I do not have a type with the same name
Either the type does not have the member in your version, or you do mistakenly have a type with the same name.
