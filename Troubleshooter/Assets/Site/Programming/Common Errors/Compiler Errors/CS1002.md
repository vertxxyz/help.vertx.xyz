Every statement must end in a semicolon <kbd>;</kbd>.

#### Why?
Whitespace[^1] is not significant in C#, functionally a piece of code can have all tabs and newlines removed and it will still run[^2], you can also add extra newlines to make multi-line statements. We instead require a terminator to tell the compiler where a statement begins and ends. 

### Resolution
Check that every statement ends in a semicolon.

### What statements need semicolons?
::::note
#### ðŸŸ¢ Semicolon required
- [Declaration statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/declarations)
- [Expression statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements#expression-statements)
- [The `throw` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/exception-handling-statements#the-throw-statement)
- [Jump statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/jump-statements)
- [`yield` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/yield)

::::  
::::note
#### ðŸ”´ Don't use a semicolon
- [Iteration statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements) (excluding the `while` in the `do` statement)
- [Selection statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements)
- [Exception-handling statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/exception-handling-statements) (excluding `throw`)
- [`checked` and `unchecked`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked), [`fixed`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/fixed), and [`lock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/lock) statements.
- [`using` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/using) (excluding when used as a declaration)

Statements followed by a block are the common place to exclude a semicolon, blocks are often defined by their opening and closing braces, <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd>, which can sometimes be omitted in single-line cases.  
:::warning
If you use a semicolon after a block statement it will become an [empty statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements#the-empty-statement), and the following block will be disconnected from the preceding statement, causing it to do nothing.
:::  
```csharp
if (example == null); // <- extra semicolon (;)
    Debug.Log($"{nameof(example)} is null!"); // This will always print because the previous selection statement has a semicolon!
```

If you are confused, look at example code to see if yours needs a semicolon.

[^1]: Whitespace is spaces, tabs, and newlines.  
[^2]: Spaces may be significant when separating keywords and names. Whitespace is significant inside of strings and characters.
