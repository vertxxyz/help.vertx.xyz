### [CS1061](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1061)
Often this error is given when new programmers do not understand the distinction between a Type and an instance.  
When accessing a member of a class directly via its name this is not referring to a single instance of it.  
This is only used when combined with the `static` keyword. Doing so will make every instance share the same member.  
This is not at all appropriate for most situations, and instead see [Referring to Members in Other Scripts](../../Variables/Members%20In%20Other%20Scripts.md).

Otherwise this means that the type you are looking at does not contain the member you expect.  
Perhaps the wrong namespace has been imported, or you have redefined the type in the namespace you are using?  
Hover over the type and ensure it has or doesn't have the namespace you expect. If the namespace is wrong, make sure you remove that namespace at the top of your file, and import the one you require.  
If you have namespace conflicts, you can resolve a type to match a specific namespace like:
