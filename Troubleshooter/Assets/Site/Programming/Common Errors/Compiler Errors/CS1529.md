## [CS1529](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/using-directive-errors#using-directive)

```
A using clause must precede all other elements defined in the namespace except extern alias declarations
```


This error occurs when `using` statements are not at the top of a script.

### Resolution

Move any `using` statements to the top of the script.

```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    ...
}

// ðŸ”´ Incorrect
using UnityEngine;
```

```csharp
// ðŸŸ¢ Correct
using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    ...
}
```

If you have put multiple MonoBehaviours or ScriptableObjects in one file you may have [script loading issues](../../Scripts/Loading%20Issues.md).  
Separate the classes into different files to fix that issue.
