### [CS0246](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0246)

#### Description
Namespaces are declared in the `using` block at the **top** of a script.  
Everything you access inside that script needs to have their appropriate namespaces referenced.  

#### Resolution
Most IDEs will help you reference the appropriate namespaces by providing quick actions when your caret is on the relevant block of code.
Visual Studio has [Quick Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quick-actions?view=vs-2019),
Visual Studio Code has [Quick Fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings),
and Rider has [Intention Actions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/intention-actions.html).  
If your IDE is not showing errors or quick fixes, you will need to [configure your IDE](../../IDE%20Configuration.md).  

#### Manual Resolution:
To manually resolve this issue, understand what namespace a Type is in by looking at the documentation or source code.  
The namespace is specified at the top of the page for the Type in question.
##### Documentation
Unity's API scripting reference can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings).  
The documentation for all packages can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html).  
##### Source Code
The C# reference source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference).  
The source code for packages added to a project can be found under the Packages folder in the Project Window.

#### Details:
Including a namespace may look like this:

If multiple namespaces contain types by the same name, the code needs to specify which is used. You can do this with this syntax:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/using Object.rtf>>
