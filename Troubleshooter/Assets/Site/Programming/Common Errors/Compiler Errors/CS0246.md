```
The type or namespace name 'Foo' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

### Description
This error is shown when a type isn't found. This is because either:
- The appropriate namespace has not been added.
- The type name has been misspelt.
- The assembly isn't referenced.

### Resolution
:::info
Click [here](../../../Building/Editor%20References.md) if you are seeing this error only while building.
:::  

Everything you access inside that script needs to have its appropriate namespace referenced.  
Namespaces are declared in the `using` block at the **top** of a script.

<<Code/Compiler Errors/using UnityEngine.rtf>>  

Most IDEs will help you reference the appropriate namespaces by providing quick actions when your caret is on the relevant block of code.  
Visual Studio has [Quick Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quick-actions?view=vs-2019),
Visual Studio Code has [Quick Fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings),
and Rider has [Intention Actions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/intention-actions.html).  
If your IDE isn't showing errors or quick fixes, you will need to [configure your IDE](../../IDE%20Configuration.md).  

### Manual resolution
To manually resolve this issue, understand what namespace a Type is in by looking at the documentation or source code.  
The namespace is listed at the top of the documentation.
#### Documentation
Unity's API scripting reference can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings).  
Package documentation can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html).  
.NET (C#) API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/).
#### Source code
The Unity C# reference source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference).  
The source code for packages added to a project can be found under the Packages folder in the Project window.

### Namespace conflict resolution
If multiple namespaces contain types by the same name, the code needs to specify which is used. You can use this syntax:
