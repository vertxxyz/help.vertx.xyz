## [CS0119](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0119)
### Description
This error is caused by identifier misuse, and can appear in many differing contexts.  

### Resolution
Some examples of identifier misuse:
#### Omitting `new` from a constructor
```csharp
// Incorrect:
Color color = Color(0, 0.5f, 0.9f, 1);
// Should be:
Color color = new Color(0, 0.5f, 0.9f, 1);
```
#### Using a type in a context which is not valid
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0119 2.rtf>>  

#### Using a method as if it is a class
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0119 3.rtf>>

You may have a method with the same name as a type. Either rename the method, or qualify that type through the use of its namespace.

#### Attempting to statically access a generic constraint
