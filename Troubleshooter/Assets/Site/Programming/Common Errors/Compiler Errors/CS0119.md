```
'Foo' is a 'Bar', which is not valid in the given context
```

### Description
This error is caused by identifier misuse, and can appear in many differing contexts.  

### Resolution
Some examples of identifier misuse:
#### Omitting `new` from a constructor
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0119 1.html>>  

#### Using a type in a context which isn't valid
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0119 2.html>>  

#### Using a method like a class or variable
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0119 3.html>>

You may have a method with the same name as a type. Either rename the method, or qualify that type through the use of its namespace.

#### Attempting to statically access a generic constraint
