### [CS1022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs1022)

#### Description
Every brace needs to be a matching set.

#### Resolution
Ensure that every opening and closing brace is a pair:  

```csharp
namespace Example
{
    public class Foo
    {

    }
}
} // This bracket should be removed
```

A functioning IDE should be underlining the approximate area of the issue in red.  
Code should also be well formatted so it makes it easy to spot mismatching braces.  

If your IDE is not showing errors, you will need to [configure your IDE](../../IDE%20Configuration.md). Unformatted code may also be a sign of improper configuration.
