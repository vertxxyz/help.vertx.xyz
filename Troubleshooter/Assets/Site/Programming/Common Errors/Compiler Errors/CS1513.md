### [CS1513](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs1513)
#### Description
Every opening curly brace `{` needs a matching closing brace `}`.

#### Resolution
Ensure every curly brace is a part of a pair, opening and closing.  

```csharp
public class Example {
    public void Method () {
    
    }
// Missing closing brace, add a } here.
```


It should be easy to spot missing braces with well formatted code as opening and closing braces should be at the same tabbed level. If your code is poorly formatted this could be a sign of an [unconfigured IDE](../../IDE%20Configuration.md).
