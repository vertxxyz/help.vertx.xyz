## [CS0619](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0619)

### Description
A class or member can be marked as obsolete. This means that it's no longer intended for use. Usually there is a replacement that should be listed by the compiler error.  

### Resolution
#### Standard Assets
If the legacy **Standard Assets** package is causing the compiler error it is unlikely those **specific** scripts will be used. Deleting those files is safe, you can always reimport the package later.  

#### General
If other scripts are causing the issue then you will need to replace the types or methods causing the error with their replacements. If it's unclear what supersedes that API you may find upgrade notes in the documentation or changelogs for that feature.  

:::info
Unity can sometimes [automatically upgrade](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/APIUpdater.html) obsolete APIs. You can trigger this upgrade by restarting the editor, importing a package, or by changing a script.
