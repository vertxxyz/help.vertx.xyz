## [CS0106](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0106)

### Description
Modifiers are keywords that describe additional information about a subject; its visibility, usage, immutability, etc.  
Modifiers can only be applied in certain contexts, and the compiler will issue this warning when one is improperly applied.

### Resolution
Remove the conflicting modifier, it is likely invalid and not required.  
Examples of modifiers: `public`, `private`, `static`, `abstract`, etc.

### Example:

<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0106 1.html>>

Local functions are always implicitly private. Remove `public` and it will compile.  

In some cases the function should not be local to a method.
Message functions will not be called if they are local functions.

```csharp
public void Start()
{
    Function();
}

public void Function()
{
    // ...
}
```  

This error may manifest itself in other forms of modifier misuse. Generally removing the modifier will fix the issue.
