```
Feature 'feature' is not part of the C# 4.0 language specification
```

### Description
Unity has multiple scripting runtimes, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.x, with 4.x more language features and APIs are enabled. Some external tools require these features, and so do some practical code advancements.  
See [.NET profile support](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/dotnetProfileSupport.html).

### Resolution

Navigate to:  
**Edit | Project Settings | Player | Other Settings | Configuration**  
and switch **API Compatibility Level** to `.Net 4.x`

:::info
Unity 2022+ has changed this to be `.NET Framework`, and compatibility has risen with the default moving to .NET Standard 2.1.
