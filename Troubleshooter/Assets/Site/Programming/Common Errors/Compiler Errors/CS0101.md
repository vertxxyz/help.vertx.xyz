## [CS0101](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0101)

### Description
This error is shown when there are conflicting types in the same namespace.  
Typically this is caused by accidentally duplicating a script.  
This can sometimes happen you move a script in Unity, then save a previously open version from your IDE.

### Resolution
Search your project for the script and delete the duplicate.  

If you recently imported an asset or script that caused this issue, you should consider moving your code into your own namespace. Namespaces are used to resolve naming conflicts.
