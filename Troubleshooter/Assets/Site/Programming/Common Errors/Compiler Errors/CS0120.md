### [CS0120](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0120)

#### Description:
Types are usually created as instances. This means that there are individual objects, and a variable can reference one of them.  
[static](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static) is a modifier keyword that defines there being only one of a type or variable.  
Static is **not** to be liberally applied. Generally the correct way to solve this error is to actually reference an instance.

#### Resolution:
If for example you have the code:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1020 1.rtf>>  

[Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html) is the name of the class, so which Transform is this referring to? [position](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html) is not defined statically, because each individual Transform has a position. The above would be the correct syntax if it was.

The code must define which instance it is positioning.  

In this case Component has a [transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component-transform.html) property defined which is the Transform they are attached to.  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1020 2.rtf>>  

But in most other situations you will have to reference members you have defined yourself, in some cases [referencing members in other scripts](../../Variables/Members%20In%20Other%20Scripts.md).
