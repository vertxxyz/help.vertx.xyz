## [CS0120](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0120)

### Description
Types are usually created as instances. This means that there are individual objects, and a variable can reference one of them.  

[static](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static) is a keyword that restricts something to a single instance, bound to the type name.  
Static is **not** to be liberally applied. Generally the correct way to solve this error is to properly reference an instance.

### Resolution
If for example you have the code:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0120 1.html>>  

[Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html) is the name of the class, but which Transform is this referring to? [position](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html) is not defined statically, because each individual Transform has a position.

The code must define which instance it is positioning.  

In this case Component has a [transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component-transform.html) property defined which is the Transform they are attached to.  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1020 2.rtf>>  

In most other situations you will have to reference members you have defined yourself, in some cases [referencing members in other scripts](../../Variables/Members%20In%20Other%20Scripts.md).
