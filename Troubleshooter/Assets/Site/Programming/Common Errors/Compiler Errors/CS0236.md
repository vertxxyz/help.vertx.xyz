### [CS0236](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0236)

#### Description:
Fields can only be initialised with values that are ensured to exist when the class is initialised.  
This means you cannot reference non-constant, or non-static data, when initializing a field outside of a method.

#### Resolution:
Initialize your field in `Awake` or `Start` instead.
