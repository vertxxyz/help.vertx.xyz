### Description
This error occurs when code contains content that doesn't belong; or code is missing, causing the next content to read as unexpected.

### Resolution
1. Understand [stack traces](../Stack%20Traces.md) to pinpoint the problematic lines. The line mentioned, or the one before it can use this compiler error.
1. Ensure your [IDE is configured](../../IDE%20Configuration.md), the area should be underlined in red.
1. Check that the previous statement ends in a semi-colon `;` if it doesn't open a scope like a `for` or `if`.
1. Check for examples of similar code and pay close attention to missing, additional, or misspelt characters.

#### Examples of extra or missing characters:
- Stray spaces.
- Missing commas or semicolons.
- Unexpected variable names.
- Keywords applied where they are not applicable.
