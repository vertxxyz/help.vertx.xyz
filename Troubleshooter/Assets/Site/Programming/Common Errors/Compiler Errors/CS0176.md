```
Static member 'Foo' cannot be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead
```


You will see this error when accessing a static member (a method, property, or field) via an instance instead of the type name.

### Resolution
Instead of accessing a member via an instance:

```csharp
GetComponent<AudioSource>().PlayClipAtPoint(position);
```

You instead need to access it directly via the type name:

```csharp
AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(position);
```
