### [CS1612](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1612)
You cannot modify members of value types directly via a property, you need to copy to temporary variables that you modify and set back to the original.
Or you need to construct an entirely new value and assign it as a whole.
Instead of:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 1.rtf>>  

It has to be:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 2.rtf>>  

Or:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 3.rtf>>


#### Details
C# will copy **by value** by default. This means:  
If the type is a **value type**, e.g. `Vector3`, it copies the entire value when used by method, property, or assignment.  
If the type is a **reference type**, e.g. `Transform`, it copies the reference, and not the value itself.  

In both cases you have a copy when you call a method/property getter, but with the reference type you're copying a pointer, and not the data.  
When accessing the copied value you will not be changing anything apart from a copy, and the compiler shows this error to enforce expected behaviour.  
When accessing a copied reference you can access and change its members because you are still referring to the original through that pointer.
