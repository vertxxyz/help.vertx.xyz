## [CS1612](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1612)

```
Cannot modify the return value of 'Foo' because it is not a variable
```
### Description
You cannot modify members of value types directly via a property, you need to copy to temporary variables that you modify and set back to the original.
Or you need to construct an entirely new value and assign it as a whole.

### Resolution
#### Example
**Instead of:**  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 1.html>>  

It has to be:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 2.rtf>>  

**Or:**  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 3.rtf>>

:::info
This same logic can be applied to any context where this error appears.

### Details
C# will copy **by value** by default. This means:  
If the type is a **value type**—`Vector3` for example—the entire value is copied when used by method, property, or assignment.  
If the type is a **reference type**—`Transform` for example—the reference (a pointer) is copied, and not the value itself.  

If a value type is returned via a method or property then it cannot be directly modified because it is a copy, the original would not be modified.
