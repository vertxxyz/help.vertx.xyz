### [CS1612](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1612)
You cannot modify members of value types directly via a property, you need to copy to temporary variables that you modify and set back to the original.
Or you need to construct an entirely new value and assign it as a whole.

#### Example
**Instead of:**  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 1.rtf>>  

It has to be:  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 2.rtf>>  

**Or:**  
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1612 3.rtf>>

This same logic can be applied to any context where this error appears.

#### Details
C# will copy **by value** by default. This means:  
If the type is a **value type**, e.g. `Vector3`, it copies the entire value when used by method, property, or assignment.  
If the type is a **reference type**, e.g. `Transform`, it copies the reference (a pointer), and not the value itself.  

If a value type is returned via a method or property then it cannot be directly modified because it is a copy, and the original would not be modified.
