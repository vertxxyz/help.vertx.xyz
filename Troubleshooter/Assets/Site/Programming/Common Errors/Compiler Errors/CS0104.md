```
'reference' is an ambiguous reference between 'X identifier' and 'Y identifier'
```


Namespaces are declared in the `using` block at the **top** of a script.  
Everything you access inside of that script needs to have either one version of that identifier in a namespace, or needs to specify which one it is referring to.  
This error mentions the two conflicting identifiers and their associated namespaces.  
This generally occurs when unintentionally including the wrong namespace as suggested by your IDE.

### Resolution
Remove the conflicting namespace that you are not using.  
**or**  
If both namespaces must be included, specify which namespace the identifier is a part of. Either by specifying the namespace when you refer to the identifier, or by overriding it with an alias:

### Examples:
If you have a conflict between `UnityEngine.Vector3` and `System.Numerics.Vector3`, remove the `System.Numerics` using from your using declarations, as it is unlikely you are referring to its members elsewhere. Same goes for `UnityEngine.Debug` and `System.Diagnostics.Debug`.
