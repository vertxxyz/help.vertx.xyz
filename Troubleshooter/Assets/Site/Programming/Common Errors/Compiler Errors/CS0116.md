```
A namespace cannot directly container members such as fields or methods
```

### Resolution
Do not put members of a type outside of its scope.

Scope is denoted by curly braces <kbd>{</kbd> <kbd>}</kbd>.
```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{ // This is the start of the class scope.
    // This is inside a scope.
} // The class scope has been ended.
```

#### Example
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// ðŸ”´ Incorrect, do not place a member outside of the class scope.
public Transform Target;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    // ðŸŸ¢ Correct, the member is inside of the Example class' scope.
    public Transform Target;
}
```

#### Example
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    // ðŸ”´ Incorrect, do not place a member outside of the class scope.
    public Transform Target;
    
    public class Example : MonoBehaviour
    {
        // ðŸŸ¢ Correct, the member is inside of the Example class' scope.
        public Transform Target;
    }
}
```
