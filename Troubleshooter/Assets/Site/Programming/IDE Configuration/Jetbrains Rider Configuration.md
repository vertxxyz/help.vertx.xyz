### JetBrains Rider Configuration

If you are having issues with your Rider install first check the few notes mentioned [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Unity.html#getting-started).  
Next ensure that the [JetBrains Rider Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.ide.rider.html) package is installed in UPM (`com.unity.ide.rider`.)  
Lastly make sure the bundled Unity Support plugin is installed **in Rider** under **File | Settings | Plugins**.
