### Visual Studio Code Configuration

Ensure you have followed all of the configuration steps listed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity).  
Where it mentions the External Tools preferences, these are **in Unity**.  
Ensuring the [.Net 4.7.1 Targeting Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471) is installed is also required.

As a last resort to troubleshooting setup try rolling back the version of the Visual Studio Code Editor package in UPM as some versions have introduced issues. You can always update it again if that fails.
