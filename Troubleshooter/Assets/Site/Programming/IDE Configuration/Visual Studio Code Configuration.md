## Visual Studio Code Configuration

Ensure you have followed all of the configuration steps listed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity).  
Where it mentions the External Tools preferences, these are **in Unity**.  
The [.Net 4.7.1 Targeting Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471) must also be installed.

---
Ensure the [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.ide.vscode.html) package is installed in UPM.  
As a last resort to troubleshooting setup try rolling back the package as some versions have introduced issues. You can always update it again if that fails.
