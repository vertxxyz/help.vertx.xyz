# Common model issues
## Rendering
- [My model appears inverted or partially see-through.](Models/Inverted%20Normals.md)
- [My model loses fidelity based on distance or scale.](Models/Floating%20Origin.md)
- [My model renders black.](Models/Rendering%20in%20Black.md)
- [A material **doesn't tile consistently** across surfaces.](Models/UV%20Mapping.md)

## Importing and exporting
- [Unity displays a different vertex count than other modelling programs.](Models/Geometry%20Details.md)
- [A `.blend` file is not imported by Unity.](Models/Blend%20Files.md)
- [An FBX file exported from Blender isn't oriented correctly.](Models/Blender%20FBX%20Export.md)
