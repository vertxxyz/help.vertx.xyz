### UI Toolkit Issues

#### General

Use the UIToolkit debugger to inspect issues with your panels, including their rects, styles, and hierarchy.  
You can find the debugger at `Window/UI Toolkit/Debugger` or `Window/Analysis/UIElements Debugger`.  
The UIToolkit Events debugger can help debug issues with element interactions.
