## FontAsset
### Description
TextMeshPro is now TextCore, and is built-in. TextCore's FontAsset is extremely similar to TMP_FontAsset, supporting an almost identical feature set. 

### Resolution
Create a FontAsset with **Assets | Create | Text | Font Asset** and assign it to your Label. Do not use a TMP_FontAsset.
