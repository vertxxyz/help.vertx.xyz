## UI Toolkit issues

### General

Use the UI Toolkit Debugger to inspect issues with your panels, including their rects, styles, and hierarchy.  
You can find the debugger at **Window | UI Toolkit | Debugger** or **Window | Analysis | UIElements Debugger**.  
The UI Toolkit Events debugger can help debug issues with element interactions.
