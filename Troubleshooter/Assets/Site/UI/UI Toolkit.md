## UI Toolkit issues
### General
Use the UI Toolkit debugger to inspect issues with your panels, including their rects, styles, and hierarchy.  
You can find the debugger at **Window | UI Toolkit | Debugger** or **Window | Analysis | UIElements Debugger**.  
The UI Toolkit Events Debugger can help debug issues with element interactions.
