## NullReferenceException: Stack trace
Stack traces are reports of the path code took to get to an execution point.  
You must understand stack traces before solving runtime exceptions.  

<<Programming/Common Errors/Stack Trace Breakdown.md>>

You can find a more detailed breakdown of stack traces [here](../../../Stack%20Traces.md).  

If the stack trace isn't leading you to a valid line of code: **save**, make sure your code has recompiled (there are no [compiler errors](../../../../Editor/Compiler%20Errors.md)), and cause the exception again.  

You should also generally be able to double-click on an error that contains a stack trace and be taken to that line of code.
