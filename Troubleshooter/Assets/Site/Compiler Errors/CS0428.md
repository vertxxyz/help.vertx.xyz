```
Cannot convert method group 'Foo' to non-delegate type 'Bar'. Did you intend to invoke the method?
```


This error occurs most often when you are using a method without invoking it.

### Example

```csharp
// ðŸ”´ The method is not invoked, this is invalid code.
var example = GetComponent<Example>;
// ðŸŸ¢ The method is correctly invoked.
var example = GetComponent<Example>();
```
