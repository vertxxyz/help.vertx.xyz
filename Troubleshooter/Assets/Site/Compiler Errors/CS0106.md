```
The modifier 'modifier' is not valid for this item
```


Modifiers are keywords that describe additional information about a subject; such as its visibility, usage, immutability.  
Modifiers can only be applied in certain contexts, and the compiler will issue this warning when one is improperly applied.

## Resolution

Remove the conflicting modifier, it is likely invalid and not required.  
Examples of modifiers include `public`, `private`, `static`, `abstract`â€”see [access modifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers).

:::warning
Certain cases may require declaring the member in the correct scope.  
For example, message functions[^1] should be declared in the [class scope](../Programming/Other/Scopes.md#class-scope).
:::

## Example:

<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS0106 1.html>>

::::note
### Removing the modifier
Local functions are always implicitly private. Remove `public` and it will compile.  

```diff
-public void LocalFunction()
+void LocalFunction()
```

:::warning
Message functions[^1] will not be called if they are local functions.  
If you're using a message function, [move the local function to the class scope](#moving-a-local-function-to-the-class-scope).
:::

::::

::::note
### Moving a local function to the class scope

In some cases the function should not be local to a method.

```csharp
public void Start()
{
    Function();
}

public void Function()
{
    // ...
}
```  

::::

This error may manifest itself in other forms of modifier misuse. Generally removing the modifier will fix the issue.


[^1]: A message function is a callback sent to a MonoBehaviour, `Update`, `OnTriggerEnter`, and so on. See [Messages](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html).
