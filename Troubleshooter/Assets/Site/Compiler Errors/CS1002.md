; expected
```

## Resolution
This error occurs in two situations:
- [A semicolon required, but is missing.](#adding-a-semicolon)
- [A statement is incorrectly written, and the line of code is incomplete.](#fixing-an-incorrectly-written-statement)

First, check if your statement requires a semicolon.

## What statements need semicolons?
::::note
### ðŸŸ¢ Semicolon required
- [Declaration statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/declarations)
- [Expression statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements#expression-statements)
- [The `throw` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/exception-handling-statements#the-throw-statement)
- [Jump statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/jump-statements)
- [`yield` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/yield)

::::
::::note
### ðŸ”´ Don't use a semicolon
- [Iteration statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements) (excluding the `while` in the `do` statement)
- [Selection statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements)
- [Exception-handling statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/exception-handling-statements) (excluding `throw`)
- [`checked` and `unchecked`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked), [`fixed`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/fixed), and [`lock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/lock) statements.
- [`using` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/using) (excluding when used as a declaration)

Statements followed by a block are the common place to exclude a semicolon, blocks are often defined by their opening and closing braces, <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd>, which can sometimes be omitted in single-line cases.
:::warning
If you use a semicolon after a block statement it will become an [empty statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements#the-empty-statement), and the following block will be disconnected from the preceding statement, causing it to do nothing.
:::
```csharp
if (example == null); // <- extra semicolon (;)
{
    Debug.Log($"{nameof(example)} is null!"); // This will always print because the previous selection statement has a semicolon!
}
```
::::

If you are confused, look at example code to see if yours needs a semicolon.

## Adding a semicolon

Add a semicolon <kbd>;</kbd> to the end of your line.  
If all errors on that line go away, it's likely the correct solution. Otherwise you may have an incorrectly written statement.

### Example

:::info
If your error isn't underlined in red you must [configure your IDE](../IDE%20Configuration.md).

## Fixing an incorrectly written statement

Statements can be written incorrectly in extremely varied ways. Compare your code structure with a functioning example to see what you're missing.

# Whitespace in C#
Whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) is not significant in C#, functionally a piece of code can have all tabs and newlines removed and it will still run[^1],
you can also add extra newlines to make multi-line statements. We instead require a terminator to tell the compiler where a statement begins and ends.


[^1]: Spaces may be significant when separating keywords and names. Whitespace is significant inside of strings and characters.
