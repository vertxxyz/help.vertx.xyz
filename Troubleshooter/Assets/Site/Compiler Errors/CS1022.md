```
Type or namespace definition, or end-of-file expected
```


Every brace needs to be a matching set.

## Resolution
Check that every opening and closing brace is a pair:

<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1022.html>>

A functioning IDE underlines the approximate area of the issue in red.
Code should also be well formatted so it makes it easy to spot mismatching braces.

:::info
If your IDE isn't showing errors, you will need to [configure your IDE](../IDE%20Configuration.md). Unformatted code may also be a sign of improper configuration.
