```
The * or -> operator must be applied to a pointer
```


It is unlikely that you should literally interpret this error, instead it is more likely a formatting mistake.

## Resolution
Remove the stray semicolon (<kbd>;</kbd>) in the middle of the line of code referenced by the [stack trace](../Stack%20Traces.md).

### Example
```csharp
float mouseX = Input.GetAxis("Mouse X"); * mouseSensitivity;
//    This semicolon shouldn't be here ^
```
