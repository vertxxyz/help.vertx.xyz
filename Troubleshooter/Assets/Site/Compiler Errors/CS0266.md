```
Cannot implicitly convert type 'Foo' to 'Bar'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)
```


Variables can only be assigned to one another if they follow some basic rules:
- The variable is the same type as the target.
- The variable inherits from the target type.
- The variable has an [implicit conversion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions#implicit-conversions) to the target type.
- There is a valid [explicit cast](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions#explicit-conversions) made to the target type.

## Resolution
Often this error is shown when there's a misunderstanding of the types involved.

### Floats and doubles
`3.2` is a `double`, `3.2f` is a float. There is no implicit conversion from doubles to floats as there could be data loss converting from larger to smaller data.  
If your code looks like:  
```csharp
public float gravity = -9.81; // Should be: -9.81f
position.x += 0.5; // Should be: 0.5f
```  
Then you've likely failed to append the `f` to indicate the `float` type.

### Other types
Understand the types of the two objects involved in the error. [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) and intellisense will help guide you to using the correct variables and syntax.  
#### Examples:
```csharp
// Should be: transform.position;
// Transforms are not positions, they have positions.
Vector3 position = gameObject.transform;
```

```csharp
// Should be: new Vector3(0, 1, 0);
// This isn't how a Vector3 is constructed.
Vector3 position = (0, 1, 0);
```

```csharp
// Should be: GetComponentsInChildren<Example>();
// The singular version of the method has been mistaken for the plural.
Example[] data = GetComponentInChildren<Example>();
```

Sometimes this error can be due to a mistake made by using assignment instead of comparison:
```csharp
// Should be: if (gameObject.name == "Example")
// Assignment "=" has been used instead of equality "=="
if (gameObject.name = "Example")
{
    ...
}
```
