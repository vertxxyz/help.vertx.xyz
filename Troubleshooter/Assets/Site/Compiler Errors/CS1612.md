```
Cannot modify the return value of 'Foo' because it is not a variable
```

You cannot modify members of value types directly via a property.

## Resolution
Do not directly modify a value type returned by a property or method.
Instead choose one:
- Copy to a temporary variable that you modify and set back to the original.
- Construct an entirely new value and assign it as a whole.

This same logic can be applied to any context where this error appears.

## Details
### Direct modification to value types
If the type is a value type (`Vector3` for example) the entire value is copied when used by method, property, or assignment.  
As the value is a copy, the original would not be modified when the copy is changed, which makes this code useless and a compiler error.

### Direct modification to reference types
If the type is a reference type (`Transform` for example) the reference (a pointer) is copied, and not the value itself.  
As the value referenced is not a copy, making direct modifications to it makes sense.
