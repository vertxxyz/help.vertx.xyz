```
Static member 'Foo' cannot be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead
```


You will see this error when accessing a `static` member (a method, property, or field) via an instance instead of the type name.

### Documentation
The documentation will specify whether a method is static, and your IDE will not provide autocomplete if you're using an instance to access that member.

## Resolution
### ðŸ”´ Don't access the member via an instance

```csharp
GetComponent<AudioSource>().PlayClipAtPoint(position);
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Instead, access it directly via the type name

```csharp
AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(position);
```

## More examples
```csharp
// ðŸ”´ Don't access the member via an instance:
var example = gameObject.Find("Example");
// ðŸŸ¢ Instead, access it directly via the type name:
var example = GameObject.Find("Example");
```
