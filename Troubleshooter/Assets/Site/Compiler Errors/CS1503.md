```
Argument 'x' cannot convert from Foo to Bar
```


An argument provided to a method doesn't match the parameter type.  

## Resolution
- If the types are `double` and `float` then the argument is likely missing the `f` suffix.  
  `1.5` is a `double`, `1.5f` is a `float`.
- Double-check the arguments provided match the method's signature, and provide the matching type.  
  If you are unsure of the arguments, use your IDE to inspect the signature, or check the relevant documentation.
- If `method group` is mentioned, it may mean you haven't correctly called the method, and are missing the braces; `Call()` for example.
- Cast or convert the arguments to the destination types if appropriate.
- If you have access to the API, create an overload to the method that takes the types you want to provide.
