```
The namespace 'Foo' already contains a definition for "Bar"
```


This error is shown when there are conflicting types in the same namespace.  
Typically this is caused by accidentally duplicating a script.  
This can sometimes happen you move a script in Unity, then save a previously open version from your IDE.

### Resolution
Search your project for the script and delete the duplicate. If your can't find it in Unity, search using your IDE's find window.  

If you recently imported an asset or script that caused this issue, you should consider moving your code into your own namespace. Namespaces are used to resolve naming conflicts.
You can learn more about them [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces).

If you cannot find the duplicate, comment out your script, once you've compiled again you should be able to navigate to the duplicate with your IDE.
