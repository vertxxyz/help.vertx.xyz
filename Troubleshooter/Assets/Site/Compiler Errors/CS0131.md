```
The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable, property or indexer
```


You can only assign a value to a variable, [property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/properties), or [indexer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/indexers).  
If you are seeing this error you have likely used the [assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/assignment-operator) (`=`) operator by mistake.

## Resolution
Correct the error by using the [equality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-operators) (`==`) or [comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/comparison-operators) operators instead:

### ðŸŸ¢ Correct

```csharp
if (a == b)
{
    // 
}
```

### ðŸ”´ Incorrect
```csharp
if (a = b)
{
    // 
}
```

:::info
If you are comparing two floats using equality, consider using a comparison operator, or [`Mathf.Approximately`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Approximately.html) to avoid [floating-point arithmetic](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-floating-point/) errors.

If you are seeing the error outside of this context, consider the content to the left of the assignment and whether it can logically be assigned to. Rework your code to make the left-hand side a single variable, property, or indexer.
