```
A field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property 'Foo'
```


Fields can only be initialised with values that are ensured to exist when the class is initialised.  
This means you cannot reference non-constant, or non-static data, when initializing a field outside of a method.

## Resolution
Initialize your field in [`Awake`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) or [`Start`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start.html) instead.
