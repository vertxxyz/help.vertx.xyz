```
'reference' is an ambiguous reference between 'X identifier' and 'Y identifier'
```


Namespaces are declared in the `using` block at the **top** of a script.  

Everything you access inside of that script needs to have either one version of that identifier in a namespace, or must specify which one it refers to.

This error mentions the two conflicting identifiers and their associated namespaces. It can occur when unintentionally including the wrong namespace as suggested by your IDE.

### Resolution
:::note  
#### Remove the conflicting namespace
If you are not intending to use a namespace, remove it.  
^^^
```diff
- using System;
```
^^^ For example, remove the `System` namespace if it's irrelevant.  
:::  

**or**  

:::note  
##### Specify the namespace
If both namespaces must be included, specify which namespace the identifier is a part of.  

You can specify the namespace when you refer to the identifier:
```csharp
UnityEngine.Random.Range(min, max);
```
Or you can override it with an alias:
```csharp
using UnityRandom = UnityEngine.Random;
...
UnityRandom.Range(min, max);
```

:::
### Examples:
If you have a conflict between `UnityEngine.Vector3` and `System.Numerics.Vector3`, remove the `System.Numerics` using from your using declarations, as it is unlikely you are referring to its members elsewhere. Same goes for `UnityEngine.Debug` and `System.Diagnostics.Debug`.
