```
The body of 'Foo.Bar()' cannot be an iterator block because 'type' is not an iterator interface type
```



The `yield` keyword can only be used in an iterator context. This requires it to be returning specific interface types.
Typically with Unity this keyword is used in the context of a [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html).

## Resolution

Convert your method to a coroutine if waiting is required, and start it appropriately.

### Example
<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1624 1.html>>

**becomes:**

<<Code/Compiler Errors/CS1624 2.html>>

:::info
Coroutines must also be started correctly, and not started continuously as they are automatically continued until they finish or are cancelled.
See [`StartCoroutine`](../Coroutines/StartCoroutine.md) and [`StopCoroutine`](../Coroutines/StopCoroutine.md) for more information.
