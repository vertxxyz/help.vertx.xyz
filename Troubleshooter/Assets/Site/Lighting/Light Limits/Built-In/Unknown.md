## Light limits: Built-in - unknown rendering path

Navigate to the [graphics settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GraphicsSettings.html), **Edit | Project Settings | Graphics**.  
Expand the [tier settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GraphicsSettings.html#Tier) tab, and note the Rendering Path used under the tier level currently used with your platform.  

- [I am using the forward rendering path.](Forward.md)
- [I am using the deferred rendering path.](Deferred.md)

---
If tier settings are not visible, you may be using a Render Pipeline, note the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings asset at the top of the page, and continue from [here](../Choose%20Pipeline.md) with the relevant SRP.
