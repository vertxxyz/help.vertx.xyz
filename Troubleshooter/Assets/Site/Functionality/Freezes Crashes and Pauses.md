## Freezes, halts, and crashes
### Freezing
Freezing is where a program does not close, but cannot be interacted with.  
- [My game freezes unexpectedly.](Freezing.md)
- [My game freezes when I hit a breakpoint.](../Programming/Debugging/Debugger.md#breakpoints)
### Crashing
Crashing is when a program closes unexpectedly.  

Check the appropriate logs ([documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html)), looking for possible causes at the bottom.
