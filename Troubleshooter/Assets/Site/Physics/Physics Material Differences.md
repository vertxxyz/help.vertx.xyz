## Physics Material differences

The Physics Materials for 3D and 2D are different. One cannot be assigned to a field that takes the other.  

3D physics uses a [Physic Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicMaterial.html) (**Assets | Create | Physic Material**).  
2D physics uses a [Physics Material 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicsMaterial2D.html) (**Assets | Create | 2D | Physics Material 2D**).
