## Character Controller: Skin width
### Description
Skin width defines a shell around the controller allowing for slight object penetration, while acting like a buffer zone to smooth out collisions.  
Skin width is a critical setting that reduces the chances of getting stuck on surfaces.  

### Resolution
Reduce the radius of the character controller, or the skin width property.
