# Colliders
Collisions cannot occur without colliders, and solid ones at that!

Double-check that the objects have colliders and they are not marked as **Is Trigger**. Triggers can be passed through, and will not stop objects.

## Correct dimensions
Ensure the dimension of the colliders and rigidbodies match.  
The 2D and 3D collision systems are separate, and do not interact with each other.
