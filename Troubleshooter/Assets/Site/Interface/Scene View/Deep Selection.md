## Scene View: Deep Selection
To select items behind others, click on the same place repeatedly to cycle through objects by depth.  
Sometimes the UI can get in the way of selection. The [pickability](Selection.md) controls can be used to disable selection of those objects. Or disabling their visibility using the [Scene visibility](Visibility.md) controls.  

### NSelection

I have authored a package called [NSelection](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NSelection) that helps with selecting troublesome items in the Scene view.  
Once installed, press <kbd>Ctrl+Right-Mouse</kbd> in the Scene view to get a list of objects that are beneath the cursor.
