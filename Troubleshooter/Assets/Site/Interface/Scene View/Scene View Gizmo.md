## Scene gizmo

The [Scene gizmo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html) is an axis navigation tool in the top right of the Scene view window.  
- Each axis arm can be clicked on to realign the view to that axis.  
- Clicking the center toggles between perpective and orthographic views, as does the label below the gizmo.  
- Rotation lock can be toggled via the lock icon to the top right.

Using the tools mentioned above you can fix most rotation issues with the Scene view.
