## Clipping Planes
### Description
The near and far clipping planes describe two bounds of the volume rendered by a camera.  
The Scene view camera automatically adjusts its bounds when focusing objects, and can be adjusted manually.

### Resolution
Select an object and press <kbd>F</kbd> to focus the camera on the object.  
Focusing an object should reasonably adjust the clipping planes in relation to its scale.

Disable **Dynamic Clipping** in the Scene view toolbar's camera dropdown to manually set the clipping planes to fixed values.
