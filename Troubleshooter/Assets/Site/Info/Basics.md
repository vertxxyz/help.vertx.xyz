## Basic debugging

### Using MonoBehaviours
1. [Add the component to a GameObject in the scene.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingComponents.html)
1. [Search the scene](../Interface/Scene%20View/Searching.md) to check for accidentally duplicated objects if they could interfere with your issue.

### General
1. Check the Console for [compiler errors](../Common/Compiler%20Errors.md).
1. Do some [logging](../Programming/Debugging/Logging/How-to.md) or [debugging](../Programming/Debugging/Debugger.md) to see what's running and that the state is what you expect.
1. If an issue is persistent, sometimes restarting Unity will fix it.
