## Understanding FixedUpdate

Fixed Update is run when it's required, it is not run every frame, and it's sometimes run multiple times.  

I like to look at this way... Fixed Update is fake ðŸ˜²  
We can simulate what happens after one second by running Fixed Update `1 / Time.fixedDeltaTime` times and it can be done in an instant; and that is practically what Fixed Update is doing. 
It is run repeatedly until fixed time catches up with real time, and the result is displayed. This keeps the delta time a _fixed_ length (resulting in consistent simulation)[^1], at the cost of fixed time not perfectly aligning to real time.

### Frame diagram

Do not visualise core logic in a project using MonoBehaviours as parallel, because it is completely linear.  
Background threads do work, including scheduling rendering, performing parallel tasks, and so on. But the execution of your `Update`/`FixedUpdate` code is linear.

```  
^^^ See that Fixed Update may run multiple times a frame, or not at all.

You can use the **timeline** view of the [Unity Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html) to see what is actually occuring in your frame.

### Fixed Update diagram
Start at the top right dot, and follow the ðŸ”· choices until the diagram exits.

^^^  
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state if_fixedUpdate <<choice>>
    [*] --> if_fixedUpdate
    note left of FixedUpdate
        FixedUpdate is run until fixedTime has reached real time.
        It may not run at all in some frames.
    end note
    if_fixedUpdate --> Update: Time.fixedTime > Time.time
    Update --> [*]
    FixedUpdate: Fixed Update
    FixedUpdateAdd: Time.fixedTime += Time.fixedDeltaTime
    FixedUpdate --> FixedUpdateAdd
    FixedUpdateAdd --> if_fixedUpdate
    if_fixedUpdate --> FixedUpdate: Time.fixedTime <= Time.time
    note left of Update
        Update is run every frame.
    end note

```  
^^^ This logic is likely simplified, the native Unity source is not public.

[`FixedUpdate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html) isn't the only code running at this fixed rate.
You can see an expanded version of this diagram in the Unity documentation: [order of execution for event functions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html).

### Notes
#### Input in `FixedUpdate`
Because `FixedUpdate` is not guaranteed to run every frame, this makes it a very poor place to poll instantaneous input.
