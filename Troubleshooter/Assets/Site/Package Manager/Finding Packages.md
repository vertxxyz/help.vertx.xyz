## Finding packages
### Pre-release packages
If a package is not visible, it may be Pre-release. Pre-release packages are not verified for guaranteed safe use.  
You can find out how to enable these packages with the current version of Unity [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/pack-preview.html).  
Pre-release was previously called "Preview".

Before 2020 this was in the Advanced dropdown at the top of UPM, but it has now moved to Project Settings (**Edit | Project Settings**). You can reach this menu using the cog at the top of UPM.  

### Visibility changes
As of 2020 the visibility of some packages in UPM has been removed. This is because they are deemed far from being verified, or are only used as a dependency to other packages. You can find more about this [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/visibility-changes-for-preview-packages-in-2020-1.910880/).  
These packages will have to be [manually added](Manually%20Adding%20Packages.md).
