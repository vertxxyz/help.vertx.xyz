### Finding Packages
#### Preview Packages
If a package is not visible, it may be In Preview. Preview packages are not verified for safe use with your version of Unity. You can find out how to enable preview packages with the current version of Unity [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/pack-preview.html).  

Before 2020 this was in the Advanced dropdown at the top of UPM, but it has now moved to Project Settings (**Edit | Project Settings**.) You can reach this menu using the cog at the top of UPM.  

#### Visibility Changes
As of 2020 the visibility of some packages in UPM has been removed. This is because they are deemed far from being verified, or are only used as a dependency to other packages. You can find more about this [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/visibility-changes-for-preview-packages-in-2020-1.910880/).
