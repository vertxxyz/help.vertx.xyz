# Project reimport
The Library folder contains the imported data that makes up your project.  
All of this data is generated from the assets and code, and can be removed and regenerated.

## How-to
Start by regenerating the script assemblies, if that doesn't work regenerate the complete project.

:::note  
### Regenerating the script assemblies
Deleting the ScriptAssemblies folder will reset most code-related issues, and only requires a partial project reimport.  
1. Close Unity.
2. Delete the **Library | ScriptAssemblies** folder at the root of the project.
3. Reopen Unity.

:::note  
### Regenerating the complete project
Deleting the Library folder will reset all imported code and assets, requiring a full project reimport. This can take a long time for projects with many assets.  
1. Close Unity.
2. Delete the **Library** folder at the root of the project.
3. Reopen Unity.
