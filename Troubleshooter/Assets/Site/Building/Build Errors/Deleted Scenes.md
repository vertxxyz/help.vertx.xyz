## Corrupted / Deleted Scenes
```
'' is an incorrect path for a scene file.
BuildPlayer expects paths relative to the project folder.
```

### Resolution
There are likely corrupt or deleted Scenes in the [Build Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html) scene list.  
Selecting the entries and removing them (pressing delete) should fix this build error.
