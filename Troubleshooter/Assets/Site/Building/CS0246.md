# CS0246 - UnityEditor

If you only receive a [CS0246](../Compiler%20Errors/CS0246.md) compiler error when building, then you've likely referenced editor-only code in your runtime assemblies.

This can be done quite easily by mistakenly approving invalid IDE suggestions.

## Resolution
To resolve this issue select the option that relates to you: 

- [I am **not** using Assembly Definitions](Editor%20Assemblies.md) (Default).
- [I am using Assembly Definitions.](Assembly%20Definitions.md)
