# Safe Mode
[Safe Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SafeMode.html) is a Unity feature that allows you to open a project *without* importing all the assets.  
In Safe Mode you have access to compilation errors through the [Console window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html) (**Window | General | Console**), and access to the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) (**Window | Package Manager**) to resolve any issues with package configuration.  

Entering Safe Mode is optional, though entirely harmless. In projects where all assets are already imported entering safe mode may be wholly unnecessary, but it is a useful feature otherwise.  

## Resolution
If you are presented with this option, it is likely best to enter Safe Mode to resolve your errors.  
It will automatically exit to normal operation once those errors have been resolved.
