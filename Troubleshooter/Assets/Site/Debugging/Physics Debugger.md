:::warning  
Your version of Unity may not have the Queries tab, you would have to update to draw queries using built-in functionality.
:::

You can [visualise collision geometry](#visualising-collision-geometry) if it's unclear what's being hit by a query.

## Visualising collision geometry
You can show collision geometry in the scene by enabling its visibility from the overlay in the bottom right of the Scene view window.
