## UV mapping

Most commonly, the way materials map to surfaces is defined by a model's UV coordinates.  
These coordinates are authored in a modelling program. This is often called "unwrapping".  

### Resolution
Author UVs for the model that appropriately tile the textures displayed on it.  

Uv mapping is a common exercise, research for your modelling program should be easy. See [Blender: UVs](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/uv/index.html).
