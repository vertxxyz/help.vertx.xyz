## Partial Transparency
### Description
Different Material types have different ways of interpreting transparency.  
Some materials may improperly handle specularity with transparent surfaces, others may not fade entirely.

### Resolution
### Built-in Render Pipeline
The [Rendering Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterRenderingMode.html) setting on the Standard shader will control the way transparency is handled.
