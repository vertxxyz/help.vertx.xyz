### Light Limits

Different Lighting Pipelines have varying restrictions on how many lights can affect objects.  
Some of those restrictions are per-object, some are on-screen, some are per-"tile". It's important to acknowledge these restrictions when choosing a pipeline, as they can ultimately influence the final art style.
