## Missing Light settings

Some settings (like **Filter and Temperature**) are dependent on various project configuration settings.

- If present, select **â‹® | Show Additional Properties** in the dropdown for the section header containing your properties.  
  You can show all additional properties by default by setting **Edit | Preferences | Core Render Pipeline | Additional Properties | Visibility** to **All Visible**.
- The **Color Space** should be **Linear** in **Edit | Project Settings | Player | Other Settings | Rendering**.  
  This will have an affect on your project, if it's early on or you can make this change it is the correct setting to use.
