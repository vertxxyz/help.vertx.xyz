### Filter Mode
#### Description
Filter Mode is how a texture appears when scaled or skewed in the viewport. By default, textures are bilinearly filtered, which means the points in-between pixels will blur between each other when not perfectly aligned.  

#### Resolution
Below the Advanced dropdown of the [Texture Importer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html#advanced), there is a **Filter Mode** setting, switching this to **Point (no filter)** will remove the blending of pixels, and colour will snap from one pixel to the next no matter how it is scaled.
