By defining a serialized field in your class scope you can define an instance to refer to elsewhere in the class.  
The field must be marked with [SerializeField](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html):  
<<Code/Variables/Prefab Reference.rtf>>  

**or** can be `public`:  
<<Code/Variables/Public Prefab Reference.rtf>>

The instance the variable is pointing to is defined in the Inspector.
