### Lightmapping
If a project consists of **many static lights**, they should be baked. This requires lightmap UVs, and pre-processing time. This gives the benefit of high-quality lighting, even global illumination, with minimal processing impact.  
See [Lightmapping: Getting started](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lightmapping.html) for more information.
