#### Lightmapping
If your project consists of **many static lights**, they should be baked. This requires lightmap UVs, and pre-processing time. This gives the benefit of high-quality lighting, even global illumination, with minimal processing impact.  
See [Configuring Lightmaps](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/configuring-lightmaps) for more information.
