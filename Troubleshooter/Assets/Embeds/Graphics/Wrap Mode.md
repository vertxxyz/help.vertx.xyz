Textures can be set to wrap, clamp, or mirror along different axes.  
As UV coordinates go out of the 0‚ü∂1 range they will experience the influence of this setting.
- Repeat will repeat the texture as if it was tiled.
- Clamp will cause the edge pixels to be sampled repeatedly.
- Mirror will repeat the texture, flipping the tiling space for every subsequent tile.
- Mirror Once will mirror only once, and will Clamp afterwards.
- Per-axis will present different options for the U and V axes.
