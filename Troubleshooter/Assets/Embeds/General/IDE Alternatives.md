#### Visual Studio
Visual Studio Community is a free, feature rich IDE that can be easily installed during Unity's install process.
You can **add it as a module to an install** through the Unity Hub if you don't have it already.  
Manual installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-for-unity?view=vs-2019#manual-installation).

#### Visual Studio Code
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity) is a free, lightweight version of VS, but it requires more setup and can be more finicky in general.

#### JetBrains Rider
[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is a paid IDE ([free for students and discounts for various groups](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/buy/#discounts)).  
It has very advanced Unity integrations that are friendly and helpful for users of all skill levels.
