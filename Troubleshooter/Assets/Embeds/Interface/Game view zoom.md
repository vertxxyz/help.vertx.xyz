The scale slider at the top of the game view represents the Game view scaling relative to the selected aspect/resolution settings chosen in the same toolbar.  
**1x does not represent filling the Game view**, the value at the left-hand side of the slider fills the Game view.

If you can't change the scale to 1x, make sure **low resolution aspect ratios** is unchecked in the resolution/aspect ratio dropdown.
