# [ðŸ¤” Unity, huh, how?](https://unity.huh.how/)
A troubleshooting website for Unity.

## Contributing
This is a personal project, it exists to give me a maintainable resource to help people on the [Unity Discord](https://discord.gg/SZy459n7) among other places, and isn't going to be exhaustive any time soon!

> **Warning**  
> This project uses symlinks. Make sure Git has been configured to handle them.

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/vertxxyz/help.vertx.xyz/issues) before contributing. Contributions must adhere to the [style guide](STYLEGUIDE.md).

> **Note**  
> This is not intended to document Unity features, but instead describe how to problem solve and fix specific problems within Unity.
> If your contribution does not fall within that, it's unlikely to have a place on the site.
